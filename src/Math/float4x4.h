/// A 4-by-4 matrix for affine transformations and perspective projections of 3D geometry.
/** This matrix can represent the most generic form of transformations for 3D objects, including perspective
	projections, which float3x4 cannot store, and translations, which float3x3 cannot represent.

	The elements of this matrix are

		m_00, m_01, m_02, m_03
		m_10, m_11, m_12, m_13
		m_20, m_21, m_22, m_23
		m_30, m_31, m_32, m_33

	The element m_yx is the value on the row y and column x.
	You can access m_yx using the double-bracket notation m[y][x], or using the member function m.At(y, x);

	@note The member functions in this class use the convention that transforms are applied to vectors in the form
	M * v. This means that "float4x4 M, M1, M2; M = M1 * M2;" gives a transformation M that applies M2 first, followed
	by M1 second, i.e. M * v = M1 * M2 * v = M1 * (M2 * v). This is the convention commonly used with OpenGL. The
	opposing convention (v * M) is commonly used with Direct3D.

	@note This class uses row-major storage, which means that the elements are packed in memory in order
	 m[0][0], m[0][1], m[0][2], m[0][3], m[1][0], m[1][1], ...
	The elements for a single row of the matrix hold successive memory addresses. This is the same memory layout as
	 with C++ multidimensional arrays.

 	If preprocessor #define MATH_COLMAJOR_MATRICES is set, column-major storage is used instead, in which the elements
 	are packed in the memory in order m[0][0], m[1][0], m[2][0], m[3][0], m[0][1], m[1][1], ...
	There the elements for a single column of the matrix hold successive memory addresses.
	This is exactly opposite from the standard C++ multidimensional arrays, since if you have e.g.
	int v[10][10], then v[0][9] comes in memory right before v[1][0]. ( [0][0], [0][1], [0][2], ... [1][0], [1][1], ...) */
