/// A 3-by-3 matrix for linear transformations of 3D geometry.
/** This matrix can represent any kind of linear transformations of 3D geometry, which include rotation,
	scale, shear, mirroring and orthographic projection. A 3x3 matrix cannot represent translation (which requires
	a 3x4 matrix), or perspective projection (which requires a 4x4 matrix).

	The elements of this matrix are

		m_00, m_01, m_02
		m_10, m_11, m_12
		m_20, m_21, m_22

	The element m_yx is the value on the row y and column x.
	You can access m_yx using the double-bracket notation m[y][x], or using the member function m.At(y, x);

	@note The member functions in this class use the convention that transforms are applied to vectors in the form
	M * v. This means that "float3x3 M, M1, M2; M = M1 * M2;" gives a transformation M that applies M2 first, followed
	by M1 second, i.e. M * v = M1 * M2 * v = M1 * (M2 * v). This is the convention commonly used with OpenGL. The
	opposing convention (v * M) is commonly used with Direct3D.

	@note This class uses row-major storage, which means that the elements are packed in memory in order
	 m[0][0], m[0][1], m[0][2], m[0][3], m[1][0], m[1][1], ...
	The elements for a single row of the matrix hold successive memory addresses. This is the same memory layout as
	 with C++ multidimensional arrays.

 	If preprocessor #define MATH_COLMAJOR_MATRICES is set, column-major storage is used instead, in which the elements
 	are packed in the memory in order m[0][0], m[1][0], m[2][0], m[3][0], m[0][1], m[1][1], ...
	There the elements for a single column of the matrix hold successive memory addresses.
	This is exactly opposite from the standard C++ multidimensional arrays, since if you have e.g.
	int v[10][10], then v[0][9] comes in memory right before v[1][0]. ( [0][0], [0][1], [0][2], ... [1][0], [1][1], ...) */

		@param localForward Specifies the forward direction in the local space of the object. This is the direction
			the model is facing at in its own local/object space, often +X (1,0,0), +Y (0,1,0) or +Z (0,0,1). The
			vector to pass in here depends on the conventions you or your modeling software is using, and it is best
			pick one convention for all your objects, and be consistent.			
			This input parameter must be a normalized vector.
		@param targetDirection Specifies the desired world space direction the object should look at. This function
			will compute a rotation matrix which will rotate the localForward vector to orient towards this targetDirection
			vector. This input parameter must be a normalized vector.
		@param localUp Specifies the up direction in the local space of the object. This is the up direction the model
			was authored in, often +Y (0,1,0) or +Z (0,0,1). The vector to pass in here depends on the conventions you
			or your modeling software is using, and it is best to pick one convention for all your objects, and be
			consistent. This input parameter must be a normalized vector. This vector must be perpendicular to the
			vector localForward, i.e. localForward.Dot(localUp) == 0.
		@param worldUp Specifies the global up direction of the scene in world space. Simply rotating one vector to
			coincide with another (localForward->targetDirection) would cause the up direction of the resulting
			orientation to drift (e.g. the model could be looking at its target its head slanted sideways). To keep
			the up direction straight, this function orients the localUp direction of the model to point towards the
			specified worldUp direction (as closely as possible). The worldUp and targetDirection vectors cannot be
			collinear, but they do not need to be perpendicular either.

			direction, and the given local up direction towards the given target world up direction. This matrix can be
			used as the 'world transform' of an object. The returned matrix M is orthonormal with a determinant of +1. 
			For the matrix M it holds that M * localForward = targetDirection, and M * localUp lies in the plane spanned by 
			the vectors targetDirection and worldUp.
		@see RotateFromTo().
		@note Be aware that the convention of a 'LookAt' matrix in MathGeoLib differs from e.g. GLM. In MathGeoLib, the returned
			matrix is a mapping from local space to world space, meaning that the returned matrix can be used as the 'world transform'
			for any 3D object (camera or not). The view space is the local space of the camera, so this function returns the mapping
			view->world. In GLM, the LookAt function is tied to cameras only, and it returns the inverse mapping world->view. */
